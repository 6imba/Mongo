# NoSQL Database
	- NoSQL Database is a non-relational Data Management System, that does not require a fixed schema.
	- It avoids joins, and is easy to scale.

# Types of NoSQL databases base on structue:
	1. Document-oriented databases:
		– Also known as a document store, this database is designed for storing, retrieving and managing document-oriented information.
		- Document databases usually pair each key with a complex data structure (called a document).
		- Eg: MongoDB, CouchDB, RavenDB
	2. Key-Value Stores:
		– This is a database that uses different keys where each key is associated with only one value in a collection. Think of it as a dictionary.
		- This is one of the simplest database types among NoSQL databases.
		- Eg: Redis, Riak, DyanomoDB, Tokyo Cabinet
	3. Wide-Column Stores:
		– this database uses tables, rows, and columns, but unlike a relational database, the names and format of the columns can vary from row to row in the same table.
		- Eg: Cassandra, HBase
	4. Graph Stores:
		– A graph database uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data.
		- Eg: Neo47, FlockDB.

# Types of NoSQL databases base on where its hosted:
	1. Cloud: AWS DynamoDB, Goggle Cloud BigTable, Azure CosmosDB.
	2. Self-Hosted: MongoDB, cassandra, SCYLA, CouchDB

# Use cases include shopping carts, user preferences, and user profiles.

# NoSQL language/approach is used by NoSQL-DBMS to manage Non-Relation_Database.

# Development & DB code is same.
# Good for CMS & Vedio platform.
