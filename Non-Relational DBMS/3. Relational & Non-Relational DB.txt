# Relation Database:
	- SQL is used to query relation_database.
	- Also known as SQL-Database(Relation SQL Database).
	- Some of popular DBMS used: Oracle, Moicrosoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, IBM DB2, Microsoft Access, SQLite, MariaDB
	- Implement Joins between related tables.
	- Possible Vertical Scaleing but not Horizetal Scaleing. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WnLrcBtq7o&list=PLBGx66SQNZ8a_y_CMLHchyHz_R6-6i-i_&index=73  ==> 26:00)

# Non-Relation Database:
	- NoSQL is used to query Non-Relation_database.
	- Also known as NoSQL-Databas(Non-Relation NoSQL Database).
	- Some of popular DBMS used: MongoDB, DynamoDB, CosmosDB, Redis, PostgreNoSQL, cassandra, SCYLA, CouchDB, AWS DynamoDB, Goggle Cloud BigTable, Azure CosmosDB.
	- No need of Joins implementation as  each document is independent.
	- Possible both Vertical Scaleing & Horizetal Scaleing.

# Characteristics:
	> Relational DBMS:
        	- Data consistency,
		- Flexibility,
		- Scalable vertically,
		- Scaling is expensive,
		- Relation among table,

	> Non-Relational DBMS:
		- Data inconsistency,
		- Flexibility,
		- Scalable both horizontally as well as vertically,
		- Easily Scalable,
		- No relation

# RDBMS : 	Database -> Table      -> Records/Row 	   -> Column  		=====> Row-oriented
# NoSQL_DBMS: 	Database -> Collection -> Records/Document -> Field(key: value) =====> Document-Orinted
