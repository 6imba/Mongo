- Schema is the model that defines/represents the data-structure in your database. (structure of document in colletion)
- Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema.
- Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection.

- Schema helps to write qurey for database.

- Some of Schema approaches we can use in MongoDB:
    - Schema Less
    - Flexible Schema
    - Strict Schema (kind of SQL approach)

- Data structure in MongoDB
    - Collection:
        - Document1: {<field1>: <value>, <field2>: <value>, ........}
        - Document2: {<field1>: <value>, <field2>: <value>, ........}

- Data type of field value:
    - String, Integer, Boolean, Double, Min/ Max keys, Arrays, Timestamp, Object, Null, Symbol, ISODate,
    - Object ID, Binary data, Code, Regular expression, ,
    - Embedded Document, Reference ID

- A field can contain a single value, multiple fields, or multiple elements.

- Approache to model a relationship in MongoDB:
    - Embedded Approache
    - Reference Approache(unique_field)

# Post and Comment relation:
    - Embedded Approache:
        {
            status: "Good Morning.",
            comment: [
                {text: "Morning"},
                {text: "Good Morning Sir"},
            ]
        }

    - Reference Approache:
        {
            status: "Good Morning.",
            comment: [comment1_id, comment2_id]
        }
    - One-to-Many relation.


- Reference Approache:
    - customer collection:
        {
            "_id": ObjectId("5f634b34348b034"),
            "name": "Amir",
            "age": 22
        }
    - sale collection:
        {
            "_id": ObjectId("a9jckcw-00000"),
            "item": "T-shirt",
            "price": 1800
            "customer": ObjectId("5f634b34348b034")
        }
