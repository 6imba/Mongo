# Non-Relation NoSQL Document Oriented Database:
  - MongoDB is a DBMS that stores schema-less records that can be pulled as JSON documents.
  - MongoDB is a non-relational, document oriented database management system and works on document based database.
	- BSON is used to query database.
  - MongoDB is a schema-less NoSQL document database.
  - It means you can store JSON documents in it, and the structure of these documents can vary as it is not enforced like SQL databases.
  - This is one of the advantages of using NoSQL as it speeds up application development and reduces the complexity of deployments.
  - MongoDB is a NoSQL databases that uses NoSQL_querying_approach(BSON) base on Document-oriented structue which is self-hosted.

# Structure of MongoDB:
	- Database -> Collections -> Documents -> Fields(key: value)
	- MongoDB  -> []          -> {}        -> field-key: field-value_BSON-datatype;

  - One Database -> Many Collections
  - One Collection -> Many Documents
  - One Document -> Many Fields:Key-value pair

  - Instead of tables, a MongoDB database stores its data in collections.
  - A collection holds one or more BSON documents.
  - Documents are analogous to records or rows in a relational database table.
