- Relation is a way how one Document interact with another Document.

# 1st way:
    # Category Collection:
        - {
            _id: ObjectId("001")
            category_name: "Summer",
            products: {
                [
                    {
                        _id: ObjectId("101")
                        product_name: "Shorts",
                    }
                ]
            }
        }

# 2nd way:
    # Category Collection Documents:
        - {
            _id: ObjectId("001")
            category_name: "Summer",
            products: {
                [id1,id2]
            }
          }
        - {
            _id: ObjectId("001")
            category_name: "Winter",
            products: {
                [id3]
            }
          }
    # Product Collection Documents
        - {
            _id: id1,
            product_name: "Shorts",
          }
        - {
            _id: id2,
            product_name: "T-shirt",
          }
        - {
            _id: id3,
            product_name: "Jacket",
          }

- Relation structure depends upon Project demand.

- Model Relationships Between Documents: (Embedded Document VS References Document)
    - Model One-to-One Relationships with Embedded Documents
    - Model One-to-Many Relationships with Embedded Documents
    - Model One-to-Many Relationships with Document References

- Embedding connected data in a single document can reduce the number of read operations required to obtain data.

- Document Relation Pattern:
    - Embedded Document Pattern
        - Subset Pattern
    - Reference Document Pattern
        - where to store reference.

Q. When to use Reference and when to use Embedded?
    Q. When to use SubSet Pattern in Embedded?

Q. What I did in Category and Product falls under what pattern?

- Proper MongoDB Scalable Schema Design, on the basis of data access patterns.

Q. Product and Categoty Relation:

    # 1. Product Schema
      {
        name:'xxxx',
        price:xxxxx,
        category:
        {
          categoryName:'xxxxx' # category name

        }
      }

    # 2. Category Schema
      {
       name:'categoryName',
       products:[
                 {
                  name:'xxxx',
                  price:xxxxx
                  },
                   {
                  name:'xxxx',
                  price:xxxxx
                  }
                ] #array or products
      }
