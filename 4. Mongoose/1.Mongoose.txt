1. Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
    - Mongoose is also known as framework og MongoDB.

2. Mongoose manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code 
and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

3. Object Mapping between Node and MongoDB is managed via Mongoose.
    - Object Data Modeling ~ Document Collection Mapper

4. Mongoose is similar to an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) you would use with a relational database. ... 
    Mongoose is an ODM that provides a straightforward and schema-based solution to model your application data on top of MongoDB's native drivers.(see img1.jpg)

5. ORM which is to map an object with a relational world, it basically converts data between incompatible types in object oriented programming 
languages. ... The main difference is that ORM is for MySQL databases, while ODM does the mapping for document representation of data.

6. How to Connect MongoDB with Nodejs:
    - install the package named: mongoose and add it as dependencies ==> npm install mongoose --save

*************************************************************************************************************************

1. install the package named: mongoose ==> npm install mongoose
Or to save this package as dependencies: npm install mongoose --save

mongoose: is a package that is used to connect with mongoDB node.js.
npm: node package manager
By “package” I mean any piece of code which someone has chosen to publish on npm.

Two ways to check whether mongoose is install in your ubuntu/debian.
    a) check locally( means into your project directory within node_modules)
        For local - npm list mongoose
    b) check globally( means in your OS within node_modules ).
        For global check- npm list -g mongoose
    It will show you the version of mongoose, if it already installed. If not then this will show this-
    /home//.nvm/versions/node/v6.11.0/lib └── (empty) npm ERR! code 1
    To install mongoose in ubuntu/debian, run this command in terminal - npm install --save mongoose
